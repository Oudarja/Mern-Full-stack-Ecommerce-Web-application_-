1)Retrieve Authentication Data:
It checks local storage for the auth key (where authentication data might have been saved earlier).
If the data exists, it parses it and uses the values to update the auth state.

If the auth state changes (due to the dependency auth in the array), this effect runs again.
It ensures the auth state reflects the latest data from local storage.

The auth state is accessible from any component wrapped by AuthProvider.
State Management:

The auth object holds two key pieces of information:
1)user: Information about the logged-in user.

2)token: Authentication token used for API requests.
Ease of Use:

Components can access and update the authentication state using the useAuth
hook, without the need for prop drilling.
